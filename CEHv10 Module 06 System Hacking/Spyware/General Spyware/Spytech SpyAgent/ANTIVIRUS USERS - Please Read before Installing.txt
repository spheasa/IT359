A NOTICE FOR ANTIVIRUS USERS - Please Read:

Modern antivirus programs can detect a wide range of potentially dangerous programs. 
This normally goes far beyond traditional viruses and worms and often includes heuristic 
alerts, which basically means that you can get alerts and warnings when an antivirus 
program "thinks it could be" something.

These warnings should be expected for the following types of applications: 
 - Software that logs or captures keystrokes 
 - Software that monitors user activity 
 - Software that allows you to recover passwords or other personal data 
 - Software that monitors or logs Internet or network activity 

Since SpyAgent can do all of the above, some antivirus solutions may deem SpyAgent as 'potentially
harmful' or a 'trojan' despite it being a legitimate tool to monitor your computer (and users). 
With all Spytech software, you can be sure our products are 100% safe to use and virus-free. 
If you run into any "trojan" related warnings, it is very likely to 
be a regular feature of the SpyAgent software that is misinterpreted by your anti-virus 
software. If you have concerns please contact us at support@spytech-web.com

If your antivirus creates any conflicts please instruct it to ignore/exclude the following files:
	c:\program files\sysconfig\ and all files contained within 
		(note: 64-bit computers will use the install folder c:\program files (x86)\sysconfig\)
	c:\windows\system32\sinvfct.dll

If you are using Symantec or Norton antivirus products you also need to exclude the signatures
'Spyware.Spytech', 'Spyware.Keylogger', and 'Spyware.NetVizor'.

Once these files are excluded your antivirus will no longer interfere with SpyAgent's operation.
For more exclusion details please see http://www.spytech-web.com/help/exclusions.shtml
