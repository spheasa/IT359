What is Spytech SpyAgent?

Spytech SpyAgent is our award winning, powerful computer spy software that allows you to monitor EVERYTHING users 
do on your computer - in total stealth. SpyAgent provides a large array of essential computer monitoring features, 
as well as website, application, and chat client blocking, lockdown scheduling, and remote delivery of logs via 
email or FTP. SpyAgent will put your mind at ease with its innovative and unmatched, yet easy to use feature-set 
that provides the ultimate all-in-one computer monitoring software package.

SpyAgent can be ran on Windows startup in active monitoring mode with an optional splash 
warning screen. This allows you to have the option to let others using your workstation 
that they are being monitored (or not). A built in stealth mode is available to keep users
from discovering or knowing about SpyAgent.

SpyAgent can be used for family and personal usage; monitoring children, spouses, or 
anyone who uses your computer - or it can be used for institutional use; monitoring students and employees 
discretely.
